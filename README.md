*TEAM_ID: TEAM(MB5)_3_04

## 📘 Project Overview  
The Smart Interactive CPR Training Application is a mobile-based solution designed to help individuals learn and practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) effectively. Many people lack the confidence or training to perform CPR accurately in real-life emergencies. This application bridges that gap by using smartphone sensors or wearable technology to monitor CPR compression depth and rate, providing instant, corrective feedback.

To enhance engagement, the app integrates gamified training modules, performance tracking, and step-by-step guides, making CPR education accessible, interactive, and accurate. It aims to empower users with the confidence and skills needed to save lives during cardiac emergencies.

This project was developed as part of the [Course/Program Name] to provide an innovative solution using [technology domain, e.g., AI, IoT, Web].
